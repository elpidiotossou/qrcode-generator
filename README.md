# QR code generator

This is a simple QR code generator written in Python. 

The script will generate a QR code for the link you provide and save it to a file called qr_code.png. You can then open the file in any image viewer to see the QR code.

Customization:

You can customize the appearance of the QR code by passing additional arguments to the generate_qrcode() function. For example, to change the QR code's size, you can use the box_size argument. To change the QR code's colors, you can use the fill_color and back_color arguments.

Usage:

This QR code generator can be used to generate QR codes for any type of link, such as a website, email, contact information, or even a text message. You can also use it to generate QR codes for QR code-based payment systems.
