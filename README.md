# QR code generator

This is a simple QR code generator written in Python. To use it, simply run the following command:

python generate_qrcode.py

The script will generate a QR code for the link you provide and save it to a file called qr_code.png. You can then open the file in any image viewer to see the QR code.

Example:

python generate_qrcode.py https://www.google.com/

This will generate a QR code for the Google homepage. You can then open the qr_code.png file in any image viewer to see the QR code.

Customization:

You can customize the appearance of the QR code by passing additional arguments to the generate_qrcode() function. For example, to change the QR code's size, you can use the box_size argument. To change the QR code's colors, you can use the fill_color and back_color arguments.

Usage:

This QR code generator can be used to generate QR codes for any type of link, such as a website, email, contact information, or even a text message. You can also use it to generate QR codes for QR code-based payment systems.

To prepare your code for GitHub:

Create a new repository on GitHub.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Copy your QR code generator code to the repository.
Create a new file called README.md and paste the above content into it.
Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
Once you have pushed your changes to GitHub, your QR code generator code will be available to anyone who clones your repository.
